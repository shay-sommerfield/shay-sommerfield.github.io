I graduated Montana State University in 2018 with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor in Mechatronics. Through my university studies, my mechanical classes involved a lot of Matlab programming to numerically solve complex math of ME systems. After learning more about how computers actually work, I opted to take classes in digital electronics, programming, and others; leading to a mechatronics minor. Ultimately I realized that I should have studied computer engineering instead, but opted to work on how mechanical systems integrate with digital electronics. 

While working at HP, I tried to gear myself toward projects that reflected my skillset. This lead to me designing software and mechanical hardware for a CNC based portable printing system to test a new product. This allowed engineering to automate their testing of this new product rather than having techs perform the testing by hand. Following this, I switched to the control systems team to try to get closer to Mechatronics again. 

While I value the experience that I gained from working on that team, I realized that I had gone the wrong direction and decided to take a break from engineering for a little while to move back to what excited me so much in school, programming and digital electronics.
